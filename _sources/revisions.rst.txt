Revision 0.2021.3.1
-----------------

- Moved **read_poscar** function from *kinematic_scattering* to *file_tools.py* and added **read_cif** function.
- Revised kinematic scattering library and renamed to *kinematic_scattering.py*. This function handles tilted samples
better.
- added **image_dialog** to *interactive_image* with interactive histogram to change contrast in images
- added multislice tools in dynamic_scattering.py  (supercell potential is rather basic)
